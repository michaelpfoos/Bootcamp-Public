/*
Problem 1
Tesla
Mercedes

Problem 2
Error because name is only defined as an attribute of the Employee Object.  
If otherName were run on it's own it would work because it gets it's value from the name attribute in the const statement

Problem 3
The first log would work because password is defined.
The second log will not work because hashedPassword is not defined in the person object. **I was wrong,  this actually returns undefined when I tested it.  Good to know.

Problem 4
false
true

Problem 5
Value
[1, 5, 1, 8, 3, 3]
1
5 and yes
